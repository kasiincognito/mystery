Mystery is a browser-based game built with HTML and JavaScript, inspired by surreal dream experiences. The player explores strange environments where logic feels slightly off, just like in a dream.

Features

Browser-based gameplay (no installation)
Simple keyboard controls
Dream-like and surreal atmosphere
Easy to extend and modify

Controls

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the character:

| Key            | Action     |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| Left Arrow  | Move left  |
| Right Arrow | Move right |
| Up Arrow    | Move up    |
| Down Arrow  | Move down  |

Controls are intentionally simple to keep the focus on exploration and atmosphere.
